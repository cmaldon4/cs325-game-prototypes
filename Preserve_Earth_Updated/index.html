<h2>Preserve Earth</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This game is an endurance game to test reflexes while self competing in order to save the Earth's environemnt by watering plants for as long as possible. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used was preservationist. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input used is keyboard only, with a combination of deterministc and randomness. The play style is competitor and performer, while the genre is racing/platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player experience intended is for the player to implement astute focus. It should feel similar to survival or the other all out modes offered in other video games. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game starts with the player in the middle of the screen. The player can move left or right, using the corresponding arrow keys on the keyboard. A timer is going which represents the score (high score correlates to longer lasting play time). Over time, an alert will pop up which is a plant requesting water. The character can move to the alert, if when they're touching the player presses the down key, the plant is watered and the alert is replaced with a heart. Every 10 seconds, the time between the alerts appearing decreases. If an alert is not watered within 3.8 seconds, the game is lost, and everything fades to black other than the score and game end text. As part of the next phase of this game, polluting items will be added to come out from the top of the screen that need to be clicked to go away, and a lives feature will be added. Additionally, alerts will be able to appear even if one remains unattended which is not part of the current prototype. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being evaluated in this prototype is movement based target acquisition with endurance performance assessment. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game is not like other games, but in enhancing this game, it will include two different catastrophes happening at the same time that require different reflexes which is unique. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting for this game is our planet needs to be protected by preventing pollution and giving it the care it needs to survive. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no story other than the premise mentioned above. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience is all of those who care for the Earth and who like to test their reflexes and endurance. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Indefinite.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
No strategies other than to practice.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game most closely relates any game that involves movement and action on objects. Most MMORPGs. The code borrowed/inspired from includes the Collision Groups, Tweens Fading in a Sprite, and Overlap Without Physics examples from Phaser. Animation of character was determined using Josh Morony's HTML5 guide and timers were derived from Lewis Lane's example.
