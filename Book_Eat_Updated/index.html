<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Literal book worms are trying to absorb words from books and itâ€™s your job to type/write the words back in before they disappear entirely. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used was book worm and it was taken more literally. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is typing, clicking, and the right arrow key. There is a little bit of randomness and a little bit of deterministic as the fade speed is random within a range of 6 and 12 seconds, but you can choose which bit you want to type. The genre would fall under racing and puzzle.Play style would be competitor, storyteller, collector, and explorer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should find the game very entertaining because the user will get a combined experience of reading a book as well as playing a game and it should encourage competitiveness to win against the book worm in order to finish reading their story as well as in general competition. </li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is allowed to traverse through the book only going forward with the arrow key. If you stumble upon a page where the worm is going to eat the words, the right arrow key to move forward is disabled. After ~2 seconds, a sound will signal that words are starting to fade (there are three separate groups of words of lengths 1-4 words long). You click on the words you'd like to type back in (a sound goes off indiciating successful click) and you have to type in the word/s exactly as they are written with spaces implied following grammatic rules. If the words are written in exactly, cases ignored, then a sound will chime marking the success and you can move forward when you'd like. If you type the phrase in incorrectly, a sound will go off indicating what you've written is incorrect, the space to type will clear so you can try again. Whenever a group of words fades to white, a life will be loss. This means that if you fail to click which phrase you'd like to type, all three phrases will fade to white and you'll lose three lives. If you click, that leaves only one text fading, so you have the potential to lose one life.

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being evaluated is typing tests/reaction time with a comparative interface.</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are many typing games that exist out there, this just couples a fun way to practice typing and test your reaction while also haveing the pleasure of reading a graphic novel. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main premise is that there is a nasty book worm trying to absorb power by eating words from books, and it is your job to prevent the worm from becoming too powerful.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is an actual story in this game due to the reading a book element and that story has to do with setting demons free that have been captured in an ancient book.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like anime, like to test their typing and who like encouragement to read.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5-15 min. depending on reading time. </li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Memorize which segments will disappear as they're not random in order to get through it faster.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say typing games from the 90's may resemble this game in a way. The Action on Click and Word Input Phaser Examples were used. This game differs from the physical prototype in that groups of text disappear instead of just one long line of text, and the user has to choose which group they're going to type back in , so that is how this game differs from the prototype. 

<br /><br /><b>Updates:</b> There is now a little backstory comic/tutorial that is the very first page of the game. I have added backspace functionality. In the previous game, backspace was just disabled so that way when pressed it wouldn't refresh the page to the last page visited. Now, it functions as a normal backspace and can be used to edit the text input. There are now different levels of difficulty that can be clicked at any point in time in the game. The different levels correlate to the amount of time it takes for the text to fade to an alpha of 0, and the default is set to easy. For hard, the fade has a potential fade falling somewhere between 6-10 s, medium a range of 10-14 s, and easy a range of 14-18 s. I also changed the way the font is loaded - there is a bug that exists in Google Chrome so I know it won't fix the font issue there, but I'm hopeful that it may alleviate the issue with the typed text from the user not showing up. I am still not entirely sure why the text doesn't show up when typed on other people's computers due to the fact that this issue doesn't exist when I run it through https on my computer and do not have this issue. I've tried clearing the cache, switched fonts, etc. and the issue still doesn't exist on my computer. I've also checked the memory and it's only around 15 MB, so I don't think it's a memory issue. This bug didn't seem to be common as I couldn't find how to address it by browsing the html forums. </li>
