<h2>Book Eat</h2>
<h2>ATTN: It seems that this game does not function well on Safari, and there are some issues with the font on Chrome, I would recommend playing on Firefox</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Literal book worms are trying to absorb words from books and itâ€™s your job to type/write the words back in before they disappear entirely. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used was book worm and it was taken more literally. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is typing, clicking, and the right arrow key. There is a little bit of randomness and a little bit of deterministic as the fade speed is random within a range of 6 and 12 seconds, but you can choose which bit you want to type. The genre would fall under racing and puzzle.Play style would be competitor, storyteller, collector, and explorer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should find the game very entertaining because the user will get a combined experience of reading a book as well as playing a game and it should encourage competitiveness to win against the book worm in order to finish reading their story as well as in general competition. </li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is allowed to traverse through the book only going forward with the arrow key. If you stumble upon a page where the worm is going to eat the words, the right arrow key to move forward is disabled. After ~2 seconds, a sound will signal that words are starting to fade (there are three separate groups of words of lengths 1-4 words long). You click on the words you'd like to type back in (a sound goes off indiciating successful click) and you have to type in the word/s exactly as they are written with spaces implied following grammatic rules. If the words are written in exactly, cases ignored, then a sound will chime marking the success and you can move forward when you'd like. If you type the phrase in incorrectly, a sound will go off indicating what you've written is incorrect, the space to type will clear so you can try again. Whenever a group of words fades to white, a life will be loss. This means that if you fail to click which phrase you'd like to type, all three phrases will fade to white and you'll lose three lives. If you click, that leaves only one text fading, so you have the potential to lose one life.

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being evaluated is typing tests/reaction time with a comparative interface.</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There are many typing games that exist out there, this just couples a fun way to practice typing and test your reaction while also haveing the pleasure of reading a graphic novel. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The main premise is that there is a nasty book worm trying to absorb power by eating words from books, and it is your job to prevent the worm from becoming too powerful.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is an actual story in this game due to the reading a book element and that story has to do with setting demons free that have been captured in an ancient book.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who like anime, like to test their typing and who like encouragement to read.</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5-15 min. depending on reading time. </li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Memorize which segments will disappear as they're not random in order to get through it faster.</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Book: <a href="http://www3.mangafreak.net/Read1_Natsume_Yuujinchou_2_51#gohere">Natsume's Book of Friends by Yuki Midorikawa</a></li>
<li>Background Audio: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jpmb-X12HG8">Natsume's Book of Friends Music from Anime</a></li>
<li>Life Lost Sound: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDF12owZAU0&t=1m22s">Anime Audio</a></li>
<li>All Other Sounds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJB92hTRAbM">Anime Sound Effects</a></li>


</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I would say typing games from the 90's may resemble this game in a way. The Action on Click and Word Input Phaser Examples were used. This game differs from the physical prototype in that groups of text disappear instead of just one long line of text, and the user has to choose which group they're going to type back in , so that is how this game differs from the prototype. </li>
