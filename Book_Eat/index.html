<h2>Book Eat</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Literal book worms are trying to absorb words from books and itâ€™s your job to type/write the words back in before they disappear entirely. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme used was book worm and it was taken more literally. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input is typing, clicking, and the right arrow key. There is a little bit of randomness and a little bit of deterministic as the fade speed is random within a range of 6 and 12 seconds, but you can choose which bit you want to type. The genre would fall under racing and puzzle.Play style would be competitor, storyteller, collector, and explorer. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should find the game very entertaining because the user will get a combined experience of reading a book as well as playing a game and it should encourage competitiveness to win against the book worm in order to finish reading their story as well as in general competition. </li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player is allowed to traverse through the book only going forward with the arrow key. If you stumble upon a page where the worm is going to eat the words, the right arrow key to move forward is disabled. After ~2 seconds, a sound will signal that words are starting to fade (there are three separate groups of words of lengths 1-4 words long). You click on the words you'd like to type back in (a sound goes off indiciating successful click) and you have to type in the word/s exactly as they are written with spaces implied following grammatic rules. If the words are written in exactly, cases ignored, then a sound will chime marking the success and you can move forward when you'd like. If you type the phrase in incorrectly, a sound will go off indicating what you've written is incorrect, the space to type will clear so you can try again. Whenever a group of words fades to white, a life will be loss. This means that if you fail to click which phrase you'd like to type, all three phrases will fade to white and you'll lose three lives. If you click, that leaves only one text fading, so you have the potential to lose one life.
