<h2>Asteroid Showdown</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In this timed event to protect Earth, you will shoot the asteroids out of the air in typical cowboy style to prevent the asteroids from colliding into Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The predetermined themes were cowboys and asteroids headed towards Earth and a combination of the themes were used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The prototype of this game uses a mouse input for an arcade genre game that is invader style. The randomness includes differing amounts of meteors at varying speeds with different trajectories towrads Earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel on edge in attempting to keep Earth safe as well as self competition to last longer than previous rounds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this game, the player can click anywhere on the screen and the pointer will follow that direction causing bullets to fire in that direction. From the very start of the game, asteroids will emerge from the top right of the screen headed towards Earth at varying speeds, trajectories, and with various asteroids coming at once. The user will attempt to shoot the asteroids from the sky with a pistol which will cause the asteroid to disappear. Should any of the asteroids reach Earth, the game is ended; however, the user has 2 minutes to attempt to protect Earth until a win is garnered. The core mechanics of the game are dependent upon Phaser in Java Script using HTML5 game framework.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To make a functional game in Java Script and HTML. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game is unique with its space cowboys and the large area that asteroids can attack. In most asteroid games, the asteroids are hitting small spaceships, whereas this has a much larger target there is more to protect which increases the challenge of this game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In this world, asteroids are in heavy downpour amongst Earth. As with any respectable cowboy, this seemingly massive individual has taken it upon himself to defend Earth until the very end. Other than this abstract reality, it is dependent upon the player to ensure the safety by taking on this cowboy shooter's role. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
I don't believe this game would have much of a storyline, it is meant to be a very brief and abstract game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
College students, cartoon fans, space enthusiasts. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes 2 minutes to play or less. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy that I would see people forming would be click speed and excessive bullet waste to ensure the trajectory of the bullets will match up with the target as practice to ensure target take down.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
A combination of Missle Control and Asteroids would be most closely related, although very different gameplay and objective. The bubbles, display circle, basic image, on collide event, active bullets, and audio examples from phaser were used. A timer authored by Lewis Lane was also borrowed.
