<h2>Open Heart</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
This is a keyboard based traversal game with the goal guiding the heart successfully into the patient without being swiped by a nurse. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme of this game is organ transplants, with a twist of revenge. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This prototype involves keyboard input with the challeneges being somewhat random with intended difficulty, the genre would fall under arcade/frontview similar to frogger but with a different perspective with, and the play style would be an achiever style. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The goal of this game is to sharpen reflexes of the player while attempting to rescue the patient during open heart surgery. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game starts with the heart intended to go inside of the patient falling from the top of the screen which experiences a gravity and falls at a set velocity. Left and right arrow keys can be used to guide the heart towards its intended destination. Based on the heart's position, a nurses hand will emerge in attempts to steal the heart. Should the heart collide with the hand or make it to the bottom of the screen without reaching the target, the heart is lost and the game is over. Should the heart land on the patient's open chest cavity, the game is won and the heart transplat is successful. The core mechanics of the game are dependent upon Phaser in Java Script using HTML5 game framework. The hand will only appear below the heart and within a certain distance to the left or right of the heart with its position changing every second.   
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic being evaluated is a functional JavaScript HTML game that uses keyboard and destination based game design. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game brings the feel of some app, phone rotation based games to a web browser. It has the same feel of the quick reflexes that go with games like SkyBurger, brought to a web game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Although this game doesn't have much of a storyline, there should be some explanation as to why a nurse would possibly want to steal a heart from a patient. In this world, the nurse would rather see the heart go to a different patient who has been waiting longer and she feels warrants having the heart instead and is attempting to foil the success of the surgery by swiping the heart away. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game doesn't really have a story, but I would guess the tension would result in the nurse losing their job should they get away with it and some unfortunate death to occur by that of the patient not getting their heart. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game appeals to a wide audience including children and people of ages. It requires no education or background, just the desire to enhance reflexes. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game takes less than 1 min. to play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best strategy would be to play it over and over again to get a feel of when the best time to dodge would be.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game most closely resembles tetris in the keyboard/gravity style and sky burger in the avoidance/dodging aspect of the game. The Phaser examples used consist of Basic Movement and Collision Groups. </li>
